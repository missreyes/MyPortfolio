A basic subscription is just $400 per month and includes a one-hour walk 5 days per week. This is obviously the most popular plan we offer, and it is clearly far less expensive than most other dog walking services which can charge $25 or more for hour-long walks. <BR><BR>Here’s another great Pet Nanny special. If you have a second dog (in the same household) it’s just $100 more per month for each additional dog (That’s less then $5 per walk, per additional dog). Many other services charge $10 (or more) per walk for an additional dog. <BR><BR><FONT size=6>Pet sitting rates and services</FONT><BR>We offer in home pet sitting, as well as pet sitting at the home of one of our pet care professionals. We do not provide kennel service, and sitting is available on a first reserve first serve basis. Priority is always given to full subscription customers. Those not on subscriptions will only be considered for pet sitting, after initial assessment of pet’s needs and temperament. Rates for pet sitting vary depending on location and required walks, feeding schedule, medications, etc. A minimum of $20 for a half hour cat visit includes feeding, playing, petting, brushing, plant watering, mail pickup, litter pan cleaning, etc.; up to $90 per day for dogs requiring daily walks and an overnight stay. <BR><BR>At this time we don’t offer a half-hour walk. We feel most dogs need more than a half-hour of exercise daily. Even small dogs, enjoy time outdoors, and our goal at NYC Pet Nanny is to provide the most effective walking service for your dog’s good health. But, why hire a walking service for a short half-hour walk, when for nearly the same price you could have a trained NYC Pet Nanny walk your dog for a full hour. Our walks are a minimum of one hour long, and often the walks are up to two hours in length (depending on the route, time spent in dog runs, and your dog’s physical condition, as well as your input as the dog’s owner). <BR><BR><FONT size=6>Referral Program</FONT><BR>Our EXCLUSIVE referral program cannot be beat. You could easily end up with <FONT size=3>“Free walks for Life”</FONT> **. That’s right. For each dog owner that you refer to us, you’ll receive a $25 discount on your monthly subscription fee*. Once you have referred just 5 new clients to us, you’ll receive your daily walks for FREE**. This is an unparalleled offer available only to NYC Pet Nanny customers. Why continue to pay for your dog’s great care, when we offer the best care available ABSOLUTELY FREE.** Why do we want to take care of your dog for FREE? We love pets, and are passionate about becoming NYC’s #1 trusted dog walking service. We have seen how some dog walking companies treat the pups in their care. We are determined to make a difference, raising the standards of the dog walking industry, and at the same time making dog walking accessible to those that need it the most; The hard working people of NYC. Sure, as a business we cannot afford to walk all of our dogs for free. But, we’ve run the numbers and as long as you do your part by referring us great clients, we can afford to be this generous with you, our most loyal customers. NOW is the time to get started. Chances are you are the only person in your building or block that is currently using our service. This means most (if not all) of your dog-owning friends and neighbors are potential referrals for you. <BR><BR>* Referred customer must sign up on a subscription plan. <BR>** Walks are only FREE for as long as you live within our routed walking areas. Other restrictions may apply. <BR><BR>Call today for a FREE in home consultation, and evaluation. </FONT></FONT><FONT color=#660000 size=4><FONT color=#660000 size=4><FONT color=#660000 size=3></FONT></FONT></FONT></P><BR><BR>
